## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently finishing my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering with a focus on sensors, machine learning, and machining processes.

Programming and maths are stuff that I really like, I also persue them in my freetime, as you can also see from my [stackoverflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/16815358/tino-d)

Check out [`ssa-tools`](https://github.com/TinoDerb/ssa-tools), a python package for applying the Singular Spectrum Analysis algorithm.

Additionally, if you are into gifting something that is not as simple as a perfume bottle to your friends, check out [ArduinoSongs](https://github.com/TinoDerb/ArduinoSongs)

In addition to the languages that I use in these repositories, I am an expert in MATLAB and have good experience with SQL.
